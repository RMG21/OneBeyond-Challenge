# Covid-19 Dashboard
This test is intented to evaluate your skills working with data and visualizing it. The source dataset will be provided and the visualization needs to be created using either Power BI or Google Data Studio.

## The problem
We have a CSV file containing statistical information about the COVID-19 spread tracking total and new cases and deaths by country and date. We need to create a dashboard showing the totals and the trends so we can examine the state of the spread at any point in time but also the progression.

## The input
The dataset is a CSV file located [here](./dataset.7z) 

## The output
You should provide a report with two pages:

* A dashboard view with the following:
    1. Total cases
    2. Total deaths
    3. Total % increase over last month
    4. A graph showing the cases trend in months
    5. A graph showing the deaths trend in months
    6. Treemap of countries ordered by deaths
* A report view showing the cases and deaths by month with filtering and drill-through capabilities (free design)

### Filters
You should allow the following filters:

* Continent
* Date period
* Data source
* Country/Province/County (only for the second page)

Extra bonus points (require external data)
1. Showing the cases and deaths normalized over the country' population
2. Source vaccine progress data and integrate it in the report
